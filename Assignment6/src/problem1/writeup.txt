Worst case complexity is when the last element of dubs is within eps from d,
or there is no element in dubs with the aforementioned condition. 

We count the number of calls to 'abs(dubs[i] - d) < eps', which is same as the
number of iterations in the for-loop. Hence, the complexity of this procedure
depends on the number of elements in the array, independent of eps and d.
We conclude that this model is of linear complexity.

The time complexity model is the following:
Let T(n) = n, where n > 0

For the worst case, n comparisons must be made in order to see if the last
element satisfies the epsilon-neighborhood criterion. 

T is of O(n) with c = 1 and x_0 = 0.
Then, for all x >= 0, we have |T(x)| <= 1*|x|, which simplifies to x = x,
a true statement. Hence, T is of O(n) by definition.
