We simply count the number of calls to assignment operator when filling in the
returning array. The number is the same as the length of the returning array
as we only assign values once per element in the array. The input to the model
is the length of the returning array, which is the sum of lengths of arr1 and
arr2. Let n represent the length of the returning array. The complexity model
is defined as: T(n) = n, where n > 0. T is trivially of O(n). 

This procedure is not recursive, so it should only occupy a constant amount of
memory in stack. 'new' keyword is used to create the returning array, where the
length depends on the lengths of arr1 and arr2. We have O(1) for stack and
O(n) for heap. Since O(n) dominates, we conclude that the space complexity
model is of O(n).

I think time complexity and space complexity are independent.
